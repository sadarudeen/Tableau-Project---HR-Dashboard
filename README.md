# Tableau-Project---HR-Dashboard
This HR dashboard projects using Tableau from requirements to professional dashboard.

##User Story: -

As an HR manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyse human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis

##Summary View

The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis

##**Overview**

The Overview section should provide a snapshot of the overall HR metrics, including:

•	Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.

•	Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.

•	Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.

•	Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)

•	Show the distribution of employees by city and state.
